## Q2 |What are the most important aspects of quality software?
There are multiple aspects of quality software, often debated with how many are listed, as some aspects can be seen as nested aspects of other aspects. Regardless I see all the aspects that I list below as being important as the removal of them would reduce overall software quality or customer experience with the software.
The imporant aspects are; <u><strong>Usability</u></strong>, <u><strong>Modifiability</u></strong>, <u><strong>Understandability</u></strong>, <u><strong>Reliability</u></strong>, <u><strong>Portability</u></strong>, <u><strong>Correctness</u></strong>, <u><strong>Efficiency</u></strong>, <u><strong>Testability</u></strong>, <u><strong>Integrity/Security</u></strong> and <u><strong>Maintainability</u></strong>.</br>
<strong>Usability:</strong> The aspect that is based around how easy is your software to use, the installation and how well the software runs for a User/consumer. Mainly around the user experience things like; navigation of software and ease of new customers to pick up and start using. An extremely important aspect because Usability drives market forces, if no-one can figure out how to install your software of if your software isnt intrinsic/ easy to learn, people are often not going to give you the time of day to understand your software enough to use it. Essentially aiming for the perfect customer experience.</br>
<strong>Modifiability/ Maintainability:</strong>An aspect of quality software that applies to a developer, modifiability is being able to change/modify existing software with new code/systems/plug-ins and not have the software collapse because of it. This is an aspect that is the polar opposite of the fragile code analogy, where your code works but "dont touch it because it might break". If your code collapses because you attempted to add a plugin like AWS or a new system to the software, then your code would not be seen as modfiable. Maintainability is often describing the same ideas as modifiability but with a few minor exceptions, the main one being can you change exisiting code without the introduction of new bugs.</br>
<strong>Understandability:</strong> This aspect is often refered to by a different name within Coder Academy but the principles of this aspect are the same. DRY(Dont Repeat Yourself) and Indentations are a standard amongst coding languages. We as developers are expected to create code that if another dev was to take over our work or come to assist us that they would be able to understand what was going on because your code was written in such a way that it would be easy to understand what belongs to what or what is assigned to what.</br>
<strong>Reliability:</strong> A reliable code is a code that will run as expected over and over and over again with little to no errors. Reliability is important as the software when it is out on the market will be being used by 100s or 1000s of people. With that in mind you want to ensure your software works reliably for every single customer.</br>
<strong>Portability:</strong> Portability is about using the software on different devices. This could be; 1. Creating something on Linux and ensuring it works for Apple or Windows software. 2.Creating a web app that can be viewed on a desktop, a tablet or a smartphone. This aspect is more concerned with the  access of your software to as many people as possible so it can have the biggest impact. It's important to have good portability because often you want to have as big of a user base as possible.</br>
<strong>Efficiency:</strong> Efficiency is about the performance of a given software on the technology. It is based around concepts like the "Big O notation" and how much computer processing power your software will take up. This is imporant because something that is very demanding on your tech so only people with 16gb of ram and 4 GPU's isn't necessarily a good business model, or something that causes your battery on your phone to drain rapidly will not be well received by users. Personally efficiency is  vital for me as I dont enjoy games and applications that cause my pc to crash or lag really badly, I moved over to consoles specfically for this reason. Efficiency is tied into the overall reception of the software/product you are making.</br>
<strong>Testability:</strong>Testing is mandatory part of programming for developers, if your software isnt tested it is viewed as you cant be certain whether the software would work reliably, you need to be able to test that your software works, that any inputs from the user will yield the results as expected.</br>
<strong>Integrity/Security:</strong>Software needs to have security, if your application handles private information then secuirty is required, as well as integrity of your software, you dont want to allow people to inject SQL code into your app to break it, giving them access to admin privilidges, or you dont want malicious users to break into the database and get peoples private information. While 100% security is impossible, ensuring that you have a healthy balance between security and accessibility is optimal for your software, no-one smart would wish to buy something not from a secured website and you would be concerned with having your private information lifted and used.

## Q4 |A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project? 

A team that is attempting to develop a website for a small business would need to have an understanding of HTML and CSS. I would say that Html experience should be enough to be able to write a page, CSS more so as the CSS will be what the small business is looking at (CSS is valueable as it is the first impressions for most people that count), CSS also allows you to modify the screen for different technologies. A language/web framework such as Ruby and Ruby on rails or Javascript and React which allows you to create multi page websites. The team would need a good understanding of databases aswell because depending on the structure or the website or how big this small business you may need to use a different Database systems( for the sake of this question I will say they need to know PostgreSQL). Aswell as being able to modify a database through the modification of tables within the database. The team needs to also have knowledge of deploying web based apps, usually done as a service that they will have to work out with the small business, this deployment service is important because it is what will keep the website running post production. Without deployment you wouldn't have a working website so to have that knowledge is vital for a web dev. I would also suggest that the team have a good ability to communicate both externally and internally. You want to be able to understand what the business wants and communicate what is possible to them, you also need to communicate who does what for the project, it is a bad use of time to have 5 people all making the same database 5 times, communicating is important! Finally depending on what the business wants, maybe the knowledge/ability to download or use different payment services, or possible verification services well, this being a small app I can possible see both of these things being used however the website could also just be a nice set up that advertises something you need to be in store to get, like a restaurant or driving lessons. But being able to track individual users for things like payment and authentication are common enough that I would want my team to be able to install a system into the website that takes care of that feature aswell.

## Q5 |With reference to one of your own projects, discuss what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and to overcome challenges.
Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Databases, Deployment, Git hub, Branching, Plugins/addons, Keys, MVC
My project that I did for CoderAcademy, the rails marketplace app. To complete that assessment I had to use alot of knowledge and skills.
Firstly I had to plan out my project using a combination of webtools / planning apps, writing out an ERD(Entity Relationship Diagram) for my ideal database and creating wireframes to have a base design for what my website will look like going forward. I also used a Trello board to plot out my process incase I get lost/ distracted.
With the planning finished I can start the app, using knowledge of the Ruby language and the Ruby on rails to create the app and a knowledge of how Github and Git pushing to create a backup of my project going forward. My knowledge of the MVC(Model, View, Controller) and Databases will have already come in handy by this point and continue to do so. When i create the app i also set up the database for the app, I then add the datatypes from my ERD's to the database in my project. Using my knowledge and skills and what I envision the datatypes to be I can set up dependencies and "null: false" statements to ensure that certain data cant be created without other data being created at the same time. Combining my knowledge of how Databases interact with Models, followed by Controllers and finally Views. Finally being able to deploy my work to a deployment site and ensuring that it works on the app/website that I deployed it to.</br>
While this is just a brief overview of the creation of the app it is important to state that my knowledge and skill with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, which the skill of setting objects/classes/datatypes and setting variables in order to set up working views. This also helped when referring to documentation and understanding what I was reading when it came to Ruby On Rails which took some time and practice. But it was process stated above and my the order in which I went about my tasks that was of the most benefit and left me feeling confident in how I would the project would work out. This skill and knowledge allowed me to do things like modify the class of the devise plug in to better suit my needs, adding a stripe payment API and adding Amazon Web Services(AWS) to my app. These skills helped me to overcome the challenges I faced during the project.

    super(brand);
    this.model = mod;
  }
  show() {
    return this.present() + ', it was made in ' + this.model;
  }
}

let makes = ["Ford", "Holden", "Toyota"]
let models = Array.from(new Array(40), (x,i) => i + 1980)

function randomIntFromInterval(min,max) { // min and max included
    return Math.floor(Math.random()*(max-min+1)+min);
}

for (model of models) {

  make = makes[randomIntFromInterval(0,makes.length-1)]
  model = models[randomIntFromInterval(0,makes.length-1)]

  mycar = new Model(make, model);
  console.log(mycar.show())
}
